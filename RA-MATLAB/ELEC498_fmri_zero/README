                  ELEC498 - fMRI practical work

This data set contains the raw fMRI data of one single subject, 
along with SPM analysis scripts.

File organization:
------------------

- batch_import_data.m
    Script to convert raw fMRI data to "origin" data that are more easily
    handled by SPM. This is the 1st script to run.
    See more details in the comments at the begining of this script.

- batch_spm_1st_level_full_pipeline.m
    Script to run the data analysis on the "origin" data, 
    comprising preprocessings and GLM fitting.
    See more details in the comments at the begining of this script.
